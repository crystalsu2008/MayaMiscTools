## How to use:
Put all scripts in a folder. It's recommended to place this folder in your Maya scripts folder, but it can be anywhere. Once you have the MayaMiscTools folder where you want it to be, then just drag and drop the "install.mel" file into Maya (drop in any viewport). This will add MayaMiscTools tool to the current shelf.<br>
